# Complete-Pathfinding-Pack
## Description
This is a basic pathfinding system that will help you to set an AI (or any other thing!). It is not designed thinking in different algorithms. It is designed to give a lot of functions in the same system so it's easy to save targets, add/remove obstacles... It just extends the original pathfinding system

Important Features!

* As easy as one line of code
* Support for dynamically adding of obstacles
* Support for multi-target support with priority
* Low RAM and CPU use
* Pure GML so all current and future platforms are supported
